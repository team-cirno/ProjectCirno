# ProjectCirno

This a project that is designing to be a backend for a video hosting site.

Project Cirno is the main server of this system. With the following main feature:
1. Provide verification services
2. Provide resources
3. Accept transaction

The project will be separate as the following parts:
1. Server building and maintenance
2. Database setup and maintenance
3. Work flow chat creation
4. Main server development 
5. Outline designing
6. Communication between server and database
7. Debug and trouble shooting

It is very likely that one person will be involved in many parts and many persons will be working tighter to create one part. Communication is essential for our success.

We will be using google’s java coding guidelines and preferable IntelliJ as IDE. All code should be in java 8.0+
Every thing should be properly explained and uploaded on git hub at least biweekly.
Lint is required and should be done every single submission. 
Indicate author and creation data time and last modified data and time.
We will be meeting biweekly via Skype or in person.

Phase 0:
1. Server & database setup SQL vs non-SQL
2. Establish connections between each member and server
3. Going thought coding outlines and requirements for each member

Phase 1:
1. Workflow chat discuss and design
2. Identity many object and structure of the server
3. Communication outline discuss and design

Phase 2:
1. Basic server setup
2. Dummy Clint setup
3. Feature discuss and design

Phase 3:
1. Implement each feature and debug
