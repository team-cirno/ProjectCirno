# ProjectCirno

This a project that is designing to be a enterprise resource planing (ERP) program.

Project Chino will start base on a server I developed droning 2018 summer. This is simple program with integrated GUI and serve. Our goal is to take features of that and build a new system software that allows us to separation server-client and other components.

Project Chino is the main server of this system. With the following main feature:
1. Make servals available for client 24/7
2. Act as the only client for database
3. Handling request and exchange data as a middle man between database and client
4. Have all the feature that ready to go and is cable to expect new features
5. Strictly following java OOP style

The project will be separate as the following parts:
1. Server building and maintenance
2. Database setup and maintenance
3. Work flow chat creation
4. Main server development 
5. Outline designing
6. Communication between server and database
7. Debug and trouble shooting

It is very likely that one person will be involved in many parts and many persons will be working tighter to create one part. Communication is essential for our success.

We will be using google’s java coding guidelines and preferable IntelliJ as IDE. All code should be in java 8.0+
Every thing should be properly explained and uploaded on git hub at least biweekly.
Lint is required and should be done every single submission. 
Indicate author and creation data time and last modified data and time.
We will be meeting biweekly via Skype or in person.

Phase 0:
1. Server & database setup SQL vs non-SQL
2. Establish connections between each member and server
3. Going thought coding outlines and requirements for each member

Phase 1:
1. Workflow chat discuss and design
2. Identity many object and structure of the server
3. Communication outline discuss and design

Phase 2:
1. Basic server setup
2. Dummy Clint setup
3. Feature discuss and design

Phase 3:
1. Implement each feature and debug

To start working oh this project, an understanding of the entirety of this project and workflow is required. This project will be broken into different parts and each part will have its own documentation provided. Each individual are expected to follow the documentation and carry out and complete respectively in one's own understanding and try to optimize as much as one can while documenting ideas and approaches. If any doubt is raised please feel free to contact the documentation providor to discuss and possibly fix or modify.

It is highly recommended to create one’s own testing file and explaining if it meets the requirements. After confirm by another member one can freely upload their code to GitHub and start working on another part as they prefer. If the issue of any sort is founded, it will be the author’s responsibility to cooperate with the finder to fix the issue and proceed with the process as normal.

We will be built and test the entire project bimonthly and the result will be posted. Working progress will be updated on got hub.
